# The Diary

A simple, minimal and word-friendly jekyll blog. Distractions shoo!

Inspired from MS Word. (o_o)

You're free to do anything with it. Free as in freedom. 

### Installation
1. Fork, Clone or Download .zip and extract.
2. Rename the writesm.github.io to yourgithubid.github.io and put it in your github directory.
3. Change title and author in _config.yml file to your liking.

### Blogging
4. Blog entries go in _posts directory in form of DD-MM-YYYY-your-topic.md files.
5. The preferred way to write content is Markdown. Google markdown syntax. It takes the pain off writing in HTML. Still, you may use HTML.
6. Remember, layout: post and published: true on top on each post file.
7. Commit and push. After a while it should be live at yourgithubid.github.io

### Notes 
I'm no expert on design. Just knew a little HTML/CSS/Ruby to put this up within some hours. 
If you wish to improve the layout or fix anything... A pull request will always be welcomed.
