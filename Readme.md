# The Diary

A simple, minimal and word-friendly jekyll blog. Distractions shoo!

Inspiration: MS Word.

You're free to do anything with it. Free as in freedom. 

### Notes 
I'm no expert on design. Just knew a little HTML/CSS/Ruby to put this up within some hours. 
If you wish to improve the layout or fix anything... A pull request will always be welcomed.
